# little project to make todo management easier
tool to look into a project tree and divide task by variable name AKA workload

## things it does
- [x] finds every todo and seperates them by var name,
- [x] opens file concerned in editor (tested very briefly in nvim)


## syntaxe
when writing a todo syntaxe must be respected todo "(variable name)" \{desc\}


## things that are going to be worked on atm
- [ ] making cli interface cleaner
- [ ] cleaner error handling
- [ ] making the parser more flexible and robust -> will only read // or /**/ lines

## goals
- [ ] parallele file search 
- [ ] Finding a more coherent way to illustrate the concerned files
